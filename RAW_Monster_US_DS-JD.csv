stanleyreid,"In a space where it is hard to be unique, our client is a VERY DIFFERENT COMPANY.  The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of.  The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee.  They help their people change projects all the time: you don't get stuck in one role for years (unless you want to stay in it). And wouldn't it be nice to be somewhere where you don't have to worry about a layoff if a project ends?  The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research and other missions.  They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need TS/SCI + FS Poly Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Analytic / Big Data Software Engineers, Full Stack Developers, Cloud Engineers, and Systems Administrators in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia.

Credence Management Solutions LLC,"Overview Global Health Technical Professionals (GHTP) is a US Agency for International Development (USAID) program that offers early- to mid-career global health professionals the opportunity to advance their careers supporting the USAID Bureau for Global Health and its implementing partners. GHTP is helping USAID improve global health outcomes in communities around the world by building a new generation of global health technical professionals who reflect the diversity of the American people. Credence Management Solutions, LLC (Credence) is seeking Health Economics Advisor within USAID’s Bureau for Global Health, Health Finance and Economics Branch under GHTP. The United States Government (USG) has made the fight against HIV/AIDS a top priority, not only for humanitarian reasons, but because the HIV/AIDS crisis threatens the prosperity, stability and development of nations around the world. The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is a USG global initiative to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic. It is the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease. PEPFAR is committed to supporting activities that are grounded in science and critical to saving lives and preventing new HIV infections. PEPFAR’s core activities include a focus on health systems, including health finance; human resources for health; commodity procurement and supply chain systems; and laboratory systems. PEPFAR recognizes that donor resources alone cannot meet the needs of the estimated 35 million people who will be living with HIV in 2020. As developing economies grow and begin to more fully realize their economic potential, unlocking domestic financing for HIV becomes a critical element of achieving long-term sustainability of the HIV/AIDS response. Countries are increasingly taking the lead in managing, implementing, and even financing their national HIV responses. The global pandemic of COVID-19 is bringing disruption to the HIV response and to the expected increase in domestic resources that would have been committed without the effects on COVID. USAID has recently completed a 5-year HIV/AIDS financing initiative to support countries to leverage their own domestic resources. USAID served as the lead agency for coordinating and implementing this initiative, and these efforts yielded a significant benefit and a substantial return on the initial investment for impact on the resources these countries will be able to put towards increasing prevention, care, and treatment coverage for achieving sustainable control of the epidemic. Now that the central initiative is completed USAID missions need to budget for financing activities in their own HIV/AIDS budgets through the country operational plan and technical assistance from the USAID HQ will be needed to help missions plan activities, budget effectively and monitor results in order to tell a global story from country specific results.  The overall objective of USAID's health systems strengthening (HSS) program, housed in the Bureau for Global Health, Office of HIV/AIDS, Systems and Program Sustainability Division (GH/OHA/SPS) is to provide USAID leadership in building sustainability of the HIV/AIDS response through investment in health systems.

With assets valued over USD $7 trillion managed on Aladdin, our technology empowers millions of investors to save for retirement, pay for college, buy a home and improve their financial wellbeing.

Credence Management Solutions LLC,"Overview Global Health Technical Professionals (GHTP) is a US Agency for International Development (USAID) program that offers early- to mid-career global health professionals the opportunity to advance their careers supporting the USAID Bureau for Global Health and its implementing partners. GHTP is helping USAID improve global health outcomes in communities around the world by building a new generation of global health technical professionals who reflect the diversity of the American people. Credence Management Solutions, LLC (Credence) is seeking Health Economics Advisor within USAID’s Bureau for Global Health, Health Finance and Economics Branch under GHTP. The United States Government (USG) has made the fight against HIV/AIDS a top priority, not only for humanitarian reasons, but because the HIV/AIDS crisis threatens the prosperity, stability and development of nations around the world. The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is a USG global initiative to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic. It is the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease. PEPFAR is committed to supporting activities that are grounded in science and critical to saving lives and preventing new HIV infections. PEPFAR’s core activities include a focus on health systems, including health finance; human resources for health; commodity procurement and supply chain systems; and laboratory systems. PEPFAR recognizes that donor resources alone cannot meet the needs of the estimated 35 million people who will be living with HIV in 2020. As developing economies grow and begin to more fully realize their economic potential, unlocking domestic financing for HIV becomes a critical element of achieving long-term sustainability of the HIV/AIDS response. Countries are increasingly taking the lead in managing, implementing, and even financing their national HIV responses. The global pandemic of COVID-19 is bringing disruption to the HIV response and to the expected increase in domestic resources that would have been committed without the effects on COVID. USAID has recently completed a 5-year HIV/AIDS financing initiative to support countries to leverage their own domestic resources. USAID served as the lead agency for coordinating and implementing this initiative, and these efforts yielded a significant benefit and a substantial return on the initial investment for impact on the resources these countries will be able to put towards increasing prevention, care, and treatment coverage for achieving sustainable control of the epidemic. Now that the central initiative is completed USAID missions need to budget for financing activities in their own HIV/AIDS budgets through the country operational plan and technical assistance from the USAID HQ will be needed to help missions plan activities, budget effectively and monitor results in order to tell a global story from country specific results.  The overall objective of USAID's health systems strengthening (HSS) program, housed in the Bureau for Global Health, Office of HIV/AIDS, Systems and Program Sustainability Division (GH/OHA/SPS) is to provide USAID leadership in building sustainability of the HIV/AIDS response through investment in health systems.
